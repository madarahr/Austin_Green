# Overview
--- 
The objective of the Austin Energy Predictor is to determine energy output (megawatt-hour, Mwh) per renewable energy farm, specifically wind and solar. Our team is collaborating with [Austin Energy](https://austinenergy.com/ae/about) to help produce vital data insights into their renewable energy farms. By utilizing a machine learning model, Austin Energy will have a more refined understanding of its overall energy output. Therefore, Austin Energy can forecast energy production from their various plants and thus better schedule power generation.

Austin Energy has provided the team with hourly megawatt (Mwh) data from their Hackberry Wind Farm and Webberville Solar Farm over all of 2019 to train the machine learning model. Also, hourly historical weather data for each farm is included in training the model. The combination of hourly megawatt (Mwh) and weather data allows the model to predict energy output based on weather factors - such as temperature, wind speed and direction, and cloud coverage. 

By training the model on a full years' data, the model comprises weather variations that are observed across different seasons. Therefore, the team used January - July 2020 hourly megawatt (Mwh) and weather data for the above renewable energy farms to test the model and evaluate its accuracy. 

The data insights generated by the model are vital since renewable energy generation varies continuously throughout the day based on available wind and sunshine. The goal is to eventually utilize the model on all of Austin Energy's renewable energy farms and expand the model to include peak power generation times. Therefore, Austin Energy will be able to predict when renewable energy being generated will be highest. 

Potential additional ways forward also include expanding this model for consumer applications.  For consumers who want to be energy conscious, they could choose when to run their products and appliances off of mainly renewable energy. By knowing when the grid mix is predominantly renewables, energy consumption could be scheduled around these times. 

# Datasets
---
The machine learning model is fed two types of data - weather data and energy output (Mwh). Specifically, the model is using Hackberry Wind Farm output (Mwh), Webberville Solar Farm output (Mwh), and historical weather data for each farm. The historical weather data for each farm has also been combined with the respective energy outputs (Mwh) to create two separate datasets - one for wind energy and one for solar. 

The 2019 data from each dataset is extracted to train the model. Then, each dataset is divided into features and the target variable. The historical weather data is the features (independent variables) input into the machine learning model, and the energy output (Mwh) is the target (dependent variable) the model is predicting. The machine learning model is then tested with 2020 data from January through July. 

After achieving an accurate model, forecasted weather data makes energy output (Mwh) predictions for Austin Energy's wind and solar farms over the specified time frame. 

## Weather Data
The machine learning model uses two forms of weather data. The first is historical weather data used to train the model, and the second is forecasted weather data used to make future energy output (Mwh) predictions. To view the API sources, visit the [World Weather Online API](https://www.worldweatheronline.com/developer/) for historical weather data and [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for forecasted weather data. 

Using the [Local Historical Weather API](https://www.worldweatheronline.com/developer/api/docs/local-city-town-weather-api.aspx), historical weather data can be pulled from any location given a date range and geographic coordinates. Multiple calls were made to the World Weather Online server using APIs to collect hourly historical weather data for the Hackberry Wind Farm and Webberville Solar Farm locations. To ease merging the weather datasets of each farm with the respective energy output datasets, the time frames of these datasets are the same. Therefore, the data collected extends from January 1, 2019 - July 31, 2020.

## Energy Output (Mwh) Data
Our team is very fortunate for this opportunity to work with Austin Energy on this project. Austin Energy has given the team access to energy output (Mwh) data for two of their renewable energy farms in Texas - Hackberry Wind Farm and Webberville Solar Farm. 

Hackberry Wind Farm is located west of Dallas, and Webberville Solar Farm is located just outside of Austin. The location of both renewable energy farms as well as Austin Energy's additional energy farms can be observed below:

Both of these datasets (found under "Resources") are provided directly by Austin Energy and contain the hourly output of the wind/solar farm in Mwh. Take a look below for additional information on each of these farms:

# Database 
---
The database used for this project is a MongoDB Atlas database hosted on an AWS server. The historical weather data and renewable energy outputs (Mwh) have been cleaned and merged on a DateTime stamp before inerting the data into the database. The main database is the wind-solar-database, which houses two collections - a wind data collection and a solar data collection. These collections can be accessed using the PyMongo driver and a connection string along with a username and password. 

## Schema

## Collections
* wind_data collection

The wind_data collection consists of the cleaned historical wind weather data merged with the cleaned Hackberry Wind Farm data. The data ranges from January 1, 2019 - July 31, 2020.
